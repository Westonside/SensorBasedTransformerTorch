# SensorBasedTransformerTorch
- This project implements the HART transforer in PyTorch from HART: https://github.com/getalp/Lightweight-Transformer-Models-For-HAR-on-Mobile-Devices
- This project implements a single modal to many modal transformer that is used for transformation classification from SelfHAR https://github.com/iantangc/SelfHAR#
- This project implements a sensor based multimodal clustering model (S-MCN) that draws implementation from https://github.com/brian7685/Multimodal-Clustering-Network
- This project processes datasets using implementation from HART as well as preprocessing for WISDM dataset implementation
